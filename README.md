# Robotic Hand Arduino Based Project

## Project Description

This project involves the creation of a robotic hand system that replicates human hand movements in real-time. The system is built using custom flex sensors to capture the user's hand movements and a sophisticated wired system using Arduino and Bluetooth for seamless real-time replication of these movements. The movements are replicated on the robotic hand using a servo motor.

The purpose of this project is to explore the possibilities of robotics and human-computer interaction. It demonstrates how we can use technology to create interactive systems that can mimic human movements, opening up possibilities for applications in various fields such as healthcare, entertainment, and more.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install the required Arduino packages and libraries.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
4. Ensure the flex sensors and servo motor are correctly connected.
